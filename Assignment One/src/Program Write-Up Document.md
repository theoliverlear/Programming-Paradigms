## Explanation

This document serves as a comprehensive write-up for the 
[Name of Your Program] project. It includes detailed information about the 
program's structure, design, and testing. The document is intended to provide
a clear overview of the project for evaluation purposes.

## UML Class Diagram

[Insert UML Class Diagram Image Here]

*Figure 1: UML Class Diagram*

The UML Class Diagram represents the structural design of the program, showing
the classes, their attributes, and their relationships. It provides a visual
representation of the program's architecture.

## Test Class

```java
// Test Class
public class TestProgram {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test the program functionality here
        // Provide test cases and expected outcomes
    }
}
```

*Listing 1: Test Program Class*

The Test Program Class (Listing 1) is responsible for testing the
functionality of the program. You can find the main method in this class where
test cases are executed to validate the correctness of the program.

## Other Classes

### Class 1

```java
// Class 1
public class Class1 {
    // Class 1 code
}
```

*Listing 2: Class 1*

[Provide a brief description of Class 1 and its role in the program.]

### Class 2

```java
// Class 2
public class Class2 {
    // Class 2 code
}
```

*Listing 3: Class 2*

[Provide a brief description of Class 2 and its role in the program.]

### Class 3

```java
// Class 3
public class Class3 {
    // Class 3 code
}
```

*Listing 4: Class 3*

[Provide a brief description of Class 3 and its role in the program.]

[Repeat this section for each additional class in your program.]

## Conclusion

This program write-up document provides an overview of the 
[Name of Your Program] project, including the UML Class Diagram, the Test 
Class, and descriptions of other classes. It is intended to facilitate 
evaluation and understanding of the program's structure and design.
